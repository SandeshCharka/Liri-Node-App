# Liri-Node-App

## What and Why?

Liri is a command line node app. It will take in certain commands and give back data based off what the command inputs are.

## Overview

The app utilizes a switch function to determine what the command line input is asking. And then proceeds to use the related functions within the app to search the proper databases and/or APIs of the input.

## Instructions

The Liri node app takes in any of these four parameters.

``spotify-this-song`` ``movie-this`` ``concert-this`` ``do-what-it-says``

## example

node liri.js movie-this batman
